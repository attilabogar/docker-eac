## Description

This project can be used to simultaneously transfer Audio CD's using [Exact
Audio Copy](http://exactaudiocopy.de/) in a docker environment on a Linux
system w/ multiple CD-ROM drives.

## Requirements

  - docker
  - docker-compose
  - system w/ one or more CD-ROM drives
  - access to `/dev/sr*` block devices

## Setup

  - `eac.rc` settings for docker-eac (see example file `eac.rc.example`)
  - `drives.txt` CD-ROM static drive mapping (see example file `drives.txt.example`)

### drives.txt

Create `drives.txt`.  The format of this file is one line per CD-ROM in a
format `<drivename> <drivemapping>`.  An example configuration file is provided
as `drives.txt.example`. To find the available CD-ROM drives run `ls -l
/dev/disk/by-id/`

Keeping CD-ROM mapping in `drives.txt` keeps the drive mapping consistent, even
if `/dev/sr*` block device numbering order changes.

### eac.rc

To customise `eac.rc`, edit and set
  - `WINEROOT` - the root directory for each CD-ROM drive's `WINEPREFIX` environment
  - `SHARE` - the directory to map as `/data` in the containers
  - `SCREEN_WIDTH` - VNC screen width (1920 by default)
  - `SCREEN_HEIGHT` - VNC screen height (1080 by default)

### WINE/EAC Setup

This part is only needed for the first time per each CD-ROM drive

  - open terminal and execute: `winecfg`
    - on the Drives tab, add `D:` drive:
      - Path: `/cdrom`
      - Type: `CD-ROM` (Advanced)
      - click apply and OK
  - copy `eac-1.3.exe` to `SHARE`
  - open terminal and execute: `wine /data/eac-1.3.exe` 
  - install EAC
    - don't install mono
    - don't install gecko
    - install these two plugins only:
      - FLAC
      - AccurateRip
  - run EAC
    - select FLAC as the compression format
    - select `03 Dancing Queen` as the file naming format

## Usage

After a succesful configuration, the docker-eac stack can be simply brought up
by runnning `./eac.sh`

A VNC remote desktop viewer application is required to access the per CD-ROM
drive environments.

The X environment within the docker container is using `openbox` as a
lightweight window manager.  Right mouse click to access the menu.
