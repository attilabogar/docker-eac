## Description

This project may be used to simultaneously transfer Audio CD's using [Exact
Audio Copy](http://exactaudiocopy.de/) in a docker environment on a Linux.

## Requirements

  - docker
  - docker-compose
  - system w/ one or more CD-ROM drives

## Setup

  - `Dockerfile` (used to build the base image w/ wine support)
  - `drives.txt.example` (an example CD-ROM drive setup)
  - `eac.sh` (shell script to bring up / destroy the eac stack)
  - make sure you are member of the `cdrom` system group

### Dockerfile

  - `USERID` (1001 by default)
  - `SCREEN_WIDTH` (1920 by default)
  - `SCREEN_HEIGHT` (1080 by default)

### drives.txt

Create `drives.txt`.  The format of this file is one line per CD-ROM in a
format `<drivename> <drivemapping>`.  An example configuration file is provided
as `drives.txt.example`. To find the drives available on your system run `ls -l
/dev/disk/by-id/`

### eac.sh

To customise `eac.sh`, edit and set
  - `WDIR` - the root directory for each CD-ROM drive' `WINEPREFIX`
  - `SHARE` - the directory to map under `/data` in the containers

### WINE/EAC Setup

This part is only needed for the first time per each CD-ROM drive

  - open terminal and execute: `winecfg`
    - on the Drives tab, add `D:` drive:
      - Path: `/cdrom`
      - Type: `CD-ROM` (Advanced)
      - click apply and OK
  - copy `eac-1.3.exe` to `$SHARE`
  - open terminal and execute: `wine /data/eac-1.3.exe` 
  - install EAC:
    - don't install mono
    - don't install gecko
    - install these two plugins only:
      - FLAC
      - AccurateRip
    - run EAC
      - select FLAC as the compression format
      - select `03 Dancing Queen` as the file naming format

## Usage

After succesfull configuration, the docker-eac stack can be simply brought up
by runnning `./eac.sh` - You will need a VNC remote desktop viewer to access
the per CD-ROM drive environments.

The X environment within the docker container is using `openbox` as the lightweight window manager.
Use your mouse' right-click to acces the menu.
